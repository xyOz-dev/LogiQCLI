## Installation & Usage

### For Windows Users

1. **Download:** Grab the latest `LogiQCLI-win-x64.zip` from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/xyOz-dev/LogiQCLI/releases) page.
2. **Extract:** Unzip to your preferred location.
3. **Run:** Double-click `LogiQCLI.exe` or run from Command Prompt/PowerShell.


### For Mac Users

#### Option 1: Build and Install Globally (Recommended)

1. **Clone and build the project:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/xyOz-dev/LogiQCLI.git
   cd LogiQCLI
   ```

2. **Build release versions:**
   ```bash
   # Use the automated build script (make it executable first)
   chmod +x build-release.sh
   ./build-release.sh

   # Or build manually for your Mac architecture:
   # For Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3):
   dotnet publish LogiQCLI/LogiQCLI.csproj --configuration Release --self-contained true --runtime osx-arm64 --output ./release/osx-arm64

   # For Intel Macs:
   dotnet publish LogiQCLI/LogiQCLI.csproj --configuration Release --self-contained true --runtime osx-x64 --output ./release/osx-x64
   ```

3. **Install globally:**
   ```bash
   # For Apple Silicon Macs:
   sudo ln -sf "$(pwd)/release/osx-arm64/LogiQCLI" /usr/local/bin/logiq

   # For Intel Macs:
   sudo ln -sf "$(pwd)/release/osx-x64/LogiQCLI" /usr/local/bin/logiq
   ```

4. **Run from anywhere:**
   ```bash
   logiq
   ```

5. **Verify installation:**
   ```bash
   which logiq  # Should show: /usr/local/bin/logiq
   logiq        # Should start the application
   ```

#### Option 2: Run Locally

1. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   dotnet build LogiQCLI.sln --configuration Release
   ```

2. **Run directly:**
   ```bash
   dotnet run --project LogiQCLI --configuration Release
   ```

#### Option 3: Use Pre-built Executable

1. **Download from releases** or build as shown above
2. **Run the executable directly:**
   ```bash
   # For Apple Silicon:
   ./release/osx-arm64/LogiQCLI

   # For Intel:
   ./release/osx-x64/LogiQCLI
   ```

### Prerequisites

- **.NET 9.0 SDK** (for building from source)
- **No runtime required** for self-contained executables

### Troubleshooting

**"Permission denied" when running executable:**
```bash
chmod +x ./release/osx-arm64/LogiQCLI  # or osx-x64
```

**"Command not found" after global install:**
- Ensure `/usr/local/bin` is in your PATH
- Try running: `echo $PATH | grep /usr/local/bin`

**Build errors:**
- Ensure you have .NET 9.0 SDK installed: `dotnet --version`
- Clean and rebuild: `dotnet clean && dotnet build`
